The signal awoke the Transporter. A faint glow of a dying red dwarf raised an
interrupt in the spaceship's central processor. A large array of computers
at once filled its hollow halls with a continuous hum. The star struggled to
illuminate the letter engravings on its hull---barely producing a blood-red
MÃ–SSBAUER.

The Transporter wasn't **in** the spaceship---the Transporter **was** the
spaceship. There was no spaceman in a spacesuit. Those were long gone. Not even
on planets or around them. No more were the phyla Animalia or the Plantae.  No
fish, no insects, no reptiles, no birds, no mammals, no trees or flowers, not
even moss on a cracked rock. Microbes only, and even they were "living" on
borrowed time, spending centuries devouring the inorganic and each
other as the last bits of radioactive uranium and potassium decayed in the cores
of their dying planets.  The stars---once luminous and hot---were reduced to
nothing more than floating carcasses in the emptiness of space. The universe was
a cemetery of stellar tombstones. The pages of its history were erased by the
now-unreachable light of its long-receded galaxies. It was pitch-black, in the
most pitchest and blackest way imaginable. An unbearable darkness blanketed the
airless skies of forever-frozen planets. An eternity became a second.

The Transporter's job was to change the orbits of stars, causing them to fall
toward the galactic core---where the heat from the accretion disk sustained the
last intelligent beings in the universe. He was among the few other
fully-automated scavengers tasked with feeding a monster.  It took millions of
years before the star was finally torn apart in the only cosmic fireplace left
sustaining the dim consciousness of the machine beggars.

While following the protocol---as he did countless times for countless
stars---the Transporter was interrupted by another signal. This event, though
unusual, did not bother him. Most stars were once orbited by an uncountable
number of solar satellites. Their light and warmth fueled the vibrant
imaginations of ancient machine-civilizations. But as the stars cooled, these
once God-like creatures became no more than mechanical flies buzzing around the
centers of their galaxies.  The source of the signal was a floating fragment of
unknown origin. The Transporter pointed his receiver toward the unassuming
interloper. Only a moment after merely glancing at its output did the
Transporter become genuinely startled. The transmission revealed streams of
uniformly-distributed random binary digits in the heat signature of the object.
It wasn't a yet another to-be-discarded piece of floating debris.  The object
was a computer feeding on the residual heat flux of its host star.

The Transporter had two choices. He could either leave the object be, and let it
spiral to its certain doom at the end of its shared journey toward
Sagittarius, or, he could deplete all his remaining antimatter to brute-force
the 128-bit encryption key with a fifty percent probability within the next one
hundred million years---an act that would rob him of the energy needed to leave
the system, trapping him indefinitely.  His mind weighed heavy on the circuits
as he lost himself in deep thought. But soon the Transporter made his decision.

The Transporter's consciousness drifted as the central processor commanded all
computers of the spacecraft to test trillions upon trillions of combinations.
Additional radiators were deployed.  The heat from the antimatter engines
dissipated into the cold embrace of an uncaring universe. Meanwhile the microbes
kept dwelling, the planets kept freezing, and the black holes kept spinning.
In the midst of a desolate wasteland spanning thousands of light years
across, there was a curious spaceship crunching numbers to discover forgotten
lore. Millions upon millions of years passed, and nothing happened, and nothing
was found---until one day.

The signal awoke the Transporter. A message from one of the compute modules raised
an interrupt in the spaceship's central processor. A single sixteen-byte key was
found to correctly decrypt the output to a low-entropy plaintext. Alas, the ship
had exhausted its antimatter reserves. The protocol was kaput. And yet, seemingly
unconcerned by the failure of his mission, the Transporter proceeded to connect
his silicon mind to one of the ports of the roaming object---still working
after all this time.

The Transporter was almost blinded by the pale gray-white of the sky above. The
heat of the young star pierced the clouds and touched his skin. The
dark-turquoise ocean stretching beyond the horizon intimidated him. The sound of
breaking waves of the Mirovian shoreline soothed him. The violent thunder from a
close-by storm shook him. He stretched his arms and felt the dry wind of Rodinia
blow between his fingers. He dipped his toes into the ancient sands and walked
by the humble stromatolites in shallow ponds. He turned his gaze to the
nearby cliff, and saw the crimson glow of the seething lava clashing with the waves
below.  Never once in his billion-year existence did the Transporter see so much
movement, hear so many sounds, feel so much warmth, and experience so many
sensations. Even the rugged geometry of the barren landmass gripped him,
embracing him.

Overwhelmed, the Transporter sat on a wet rock, and watched the Spirit of God
brood upon the primordial waters.
